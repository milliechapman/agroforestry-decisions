2018,39,"short-term/seasonal and long-term",,,55000,1,"Tier 2","Averages for CFLR impacts in Column E based on 2012-2017 data, as 2017 is the most recent year for which data is currently available and 2012 was the first year with 23 projects. Labor income total is for 2011-2017.  Labor income and jobs data is based on economic modelling using the Treatment for Restoration Economic Analysis Toolkit. More information at https://www.fs.fed.us/restoration/CFLRP/guidance.shtml.  The restoration work associated with the 23 projects of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (roughly 10 percent of Forest Service accomplishments under the Bonn Challenge), has generated an average of  5,500 jobs per year and a total of $1.5 billion in local labor income.  Since CFLR restoration work represents on average 10% of Forest Service work reported under the Bonn Challenge, our economists estimate the total number of jobs created or maintained is 55,000 per year.  Note that the jobs cannot be summed across years.
