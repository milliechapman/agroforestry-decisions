2018,5200000,1,"Tier 2",0,"The United States Forest Service (USFS) is only reporting carbon benefits from the subset of its restoration treatments that are reforestation.  For 2011 to 2017 USFS and its partners reforested 566,000 hectares through a combination of tree planting and certified natural regeneration.  We estimated the carbon benefits by using national average estimates of gross sequestration from above and belowground live trees for regeneration, adjusting for the difference in sequestration rates for the first 0-5 years post-treatment vs. 6-10 years post-treatment.  The total estimate for 2011-2017 is 5.22 MMT CO2 Eq., with an upper 95% CI of 17.6 MMT and a lower 95% CI of 187 MT.  Further details on the estimation method available upon request.",
