The planning rule sets forth process and content requirements to guide the development, amendment, and revision of land management plans for the 155 national forests and 19 national grasslands of the United States National Forest System (NFS).  These land management plans guide the design and implementation of restoration activities reported by the United States for the Bonn Challenge.
Land management plans use a complementary ecosystem and species-specific approach to provide for the diversity of plant and animal communities and maintain the persistence of native species in the plan area. Plan components include: 1) Desired Conditions that provide ecological descriptions for healthy ecosystems, 2) Objectives for maintaining or restoring healthy ecosystems, 3) Guidelines providing management direction within ecosystems, and 4) Standards that must be followed to sustain ecosystem integrity.  Species-specific plan components are included where necessary to provide the ecological conditions to contribute to the recovery of United States federally listed threatened and endangered species, conserve proposed and candidate species, and maintain viable populations of species of conservation concern. Plans also require monitoring select ecological and watershed conditions.  In addition, plans use focal species to assess ecosystem function and ecological conditions that contribute towards meeting diversity and ecological sustainability requirements.  
The USFS and its partners design and implement restoration activities according to the local plan components, resulting in treatments that maintain or enhance biodiversity of plant and animal communities across all 155 national forests and 19 national grasslands.  A shape file of all NFS unit boundaries is available at https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php. A list of the Key Biological Areas that intersect with the NFS units is provided in attached Excel file KBA_NFS_Intersect_US_BonnBarometer_20180823v2.xls.    ",
